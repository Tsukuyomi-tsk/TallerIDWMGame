"""The single canonical definition of "is this offer live right now".

Introduced in Fase 1 (ahead of the catalog/checkout phases) because the
seeder needs correct, non-duplicated pricing to produce trustworthy demo
data. Every place in the app that needs an effective price — catalog
(Fase 3), cart and checkout (Fase 5), and this seeder — must call these
helpers, never re-derive the condition inline. A copy that forgets
`is_active` would apply discounts an admin explicitly turned off.
